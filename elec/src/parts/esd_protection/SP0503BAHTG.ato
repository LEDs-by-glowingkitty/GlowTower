    """
    This is an ESD protection diode. It is used to protect sensitive components from ESD damage.
    ESD stands for Electro-Static Discharge. It is a sudden flow of electricity between two electrically charged objects caused by contact, an electrical short, or dielectric breakdown.
    More specifically: it is an Uni-directional 3-Line TVS Array
